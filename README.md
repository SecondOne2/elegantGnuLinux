 ### How to configure dropbear for use dropbear keys with openssh
 
 > The thing is that termux shell don't use passwords logins so the only way for connect to termux with ssh is with RSA keys, here the confusion, dropbear use they own format of private keys, so here the steps for configure well the dropbear ssh server, first the private keys is in this path from your termux home, remember that this is based in the folder structure that use termux:
 
 `../usr/etc/dropbear`
 
 > In this path, you will find the private keys (the keys that need the client ssh of drobear/openssh for connect to the server), this is important, dropbear by default don't make in automatic the folder ssh(folder $HOME/.ssh ) and the file ($HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys) for work well, so the first is create it:
 
`mkdir ~/.ssh`

> Then we print the public key of our private key, and we add to the file authorized_keys, the next command create the file authorized_keys and send the public key to it:

`dropbearkey -y -f ~/../usr/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key | grep "^ssh-rsa " >> ~/ssh/authorized_keys`

> Then we only use the dropbear_rsa_host_key (Just if we're using the dropbear client "dbclient"), if we  gonna use openssh for connect to the dropbear server, we must to convert the private key to openssh format this is do it, with the command dropbearconvert:

`dropbearconvert dropbear openssh ~/../usr/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key $HOME/rsa_dropbearkey_openssh`

> Then of this you only need to change the permission lread and write over the key, the key only must have permission of read and write for the owner(user), if you don't change the permission the client will not use the key, so here the command(from termux another case you must use sudo with this command):

`chmod g-rw,o-r $HOME/rsa_dropbearkey_openssh`

> Then you only need share private key to the device with you gonna connect to the ssh server of dropbear, you can share it from termux running a http server in the path where is the private key, in this case is the home of termux(use the command "ifconfig" or "ip address" for know the ip of your device), so the command is this:

`cd; python -m http.server 8080`

> Then just connect to the ip address of your device that is running the dropbear server from your web browser putting in the url bar the ip and the port 192.168.0.10:8080 and just select the key and click in it, the key will be downloaded and you can use for connect


> And for last for use the private key just use the argument -i in your ssh command for specific which key use it(This from client openssh):

`ssh -i rsa_dropbearkey_openssh 192.168.0.10`
